    <p> Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. Messi always followed his two older brothers and played soccer with their friends.
  By the age of eight, Lionel Messi was invited to play for a youth system of Newell's Old Boys, which is a Rosario-based club. Messi was smaller than kids his age. Later
doctors diagnosed Messi with a hormone deficiency which restricts growth. Messi's parents could not afford the monthly medication. However, 13 year old Messi
was offered a chance to train with FC Barcelona's Youth Academy, and with this opportunity, the club offered to pay for Messi's medication. Messi's family then moved to Spain.</p>
